// this is where Scala will implicitly ( educated guess) on what parameter should be passed
// into a implicity parameter list,
// it looks at the block called it and look for implicit definitions it can match up
// if not then it looks to the companion object for implicit parameters
// This sounds like it can get very messy very quickly
